# PasswordGenerator-Tester
This Python program generates secure, random passwords by combining words, numbers, and special characters. It uses the passwordmeter library to evaluate the strength of the generated password. The program automatically downloads a word list from GitHub if it doesn't already exist, ensuring fresh and varied password generation.
